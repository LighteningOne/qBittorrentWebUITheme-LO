# qBittorrentWebUITheme-LO
I am currently working on the style of the original webui files from the scratch to change the theme for working at night. Light theme is definitely not the way to go if you work at night. Hence, this project. You can find the original [here](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent).

There is a big reasons behind doing this from the scratch. Ofcourse there are few themes out there but not much for the WebUI. I did found one [iFelix18/Dark-qBittorrent-WebUI](https://github.com/iFelix18/Dark-qBittorrent-WebUI) I got my inspiration but while implementing his instructions I found it's not working perfectly for me after in login.

There is not much changes made here just some colour tweeking and that's all.
